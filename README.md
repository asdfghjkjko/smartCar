# smartCar
The smart car is a highly computerized automobile featuring ubiquitous computing, intuitive human-computer interaction and an open application platform. Here, we propose an advanced Smart Car demonstration platform with a transparent windshield display and various motion sensors where drivers can manipulate a variety of car-appropriate applications in augmented reality. Similar to smartphones, drivers can customize their Smart Car through free downloads of car-appropriate applications according to their wants and needs.

Intelligent Communication System: Enables the vehicle to communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure, improving traffic flow and safety.

Automated Parking System: Capable of autonomously finding parking spaces and parking the vehicle.

Remote Control: Allows remote control of the vehicle via a mobile app, such as unlocking, preheating, or charging.

Vehicle Health Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of the vehicle's status, providing reminders for regular maintenance and servicing.
